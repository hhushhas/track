# Architecture

Status: current running architecture. Company collaboration, task management,
and Channel threads are implemented behind independent default-off server
release flags. Other approved target changes remain in the roadmap and
companion specifications until their release gates pass.

Track is a pnpm monorepo with a TanStack Start web application, an Expo mobile application, shared TypeScript domain code, and a Convex backend.

## Runtime stack

- Node.js 24, pnpm 10.19.0, TypeScript 7.0.2.
- React 19, TanStack Start/Router, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Base UI on web.
- Expo 55, Expo Router, and React Native on mobile.
- Convex for persistence, realtime queries, files, scheduled jobs, search, and server functions.
- Better Auth for sessions, OAuth, two-factor authentication, and the Convex auth bridge.
- AI SDK with OpenRouter for assistant model calls.
- Upstash Box for imported project-memory storage; Convex retains metadata, access state, and audit events.
- Cloudflare Workers for the web runtime and EAS for native builds.

## Package boundaries

`apps/web` owns browser routes, PWA behavior, workspace presentation, search, and browser integrations. `apps/mobile` owns native navigation and native platform capabilities. `packages/shared` contains platform-neutral Company, Project, Channel, task-policy, thread, role, notification, mention, and theme primitives. `convex` owns all persistent data and server-side authorization.

Clients may hide unavailable controls for usability, but Convex functions enforce every permission boundary. Public functions validate identity and access before reading or mutating data. Internal functions are used for trusted jobs and multi-step workflows.

## Core data flow

1. Better Auth establishes a session and the Convex bridge supplies its token.
2. Convex resolves the application user and project/group membership.
3. Reactive queries deliver accessible project, group, conversation, search, and notification state.
4. Mutations validate access, write the domain change, and emit audit or notification effects where required.
5. AI workflows assemble permission-filtered context, stream or persist results, and retain references.

The schema in `convex/schema.ts` is the authoritative inventory of persisted data. Shared domain constants in `packages/shared/src/domain.ts` must match schema validators.

## Company collaboration and authorization

Company-model Projects use an explicit chain: authenticated user → active
Company membership → active or archived Project membership → exact Channel
membership or frozen archive entitlement. The central request-authorization
adapter owns this chain and the compatibility read for legacy Projects. Company
or Relationship administration never substitutes for content membership.

Companies have owner, admin, and member roles. Company-model Projects use only
manager and member roles. Relationship terms, Project-Company terms, Project
memberships, and Channel memberships retain lifecycle history instead of being
overwritten or hard-deleted. Participant revisions make unanimous removal and
archive approvals stale when eligibility changes.

Shared-Project exit is a two-phase saga. Preparation revokes live access and
captures a cutoff. A Node action copies only the leaving Company's authorized
Project and Channel memory sources to immutable paths, records content hashes,
and verifies the manifest before finalization can create read-only entitlements.
Provider failure blocks finalization; cancellation retains a retryable cleanup
pointer until orphan cleanup succeeds.

Guided legacy migration records an explicit Company and neutral role for every
member, requires each mapped Company to confirm its own people, preserves every
Group membership exactly, and activates the new policy atomically. No Company
identity or neutral role is inferred from legacy roles, labels, email domains,
or Group access.

## Channel threads

Threads use `channelThreads` for lifecycle and indexed summary state, while
their replies remain ordinary `messages` with a `channelThreadId`. One
server-issued Channel sequence spans timeline and thread messages. Followers
and read cursors are keyed by exact Project membership, so one user acting for
two Companies never shares thread state across represented contexts.

Thread authorization always resolves through the parent Project and Channel.
There is no thread membership table or private-thread policy. Source links,
search, notifications, reports, assistant context, attachments, deep links,
unread aggregation, and Company-exit snapshots apply that same boundary.
Focused message history is cursor-paginated, while denormalized counters keep
thread lists and source chips bounded.

`TRACK_THREADS_ENABLED` is independent from Company collaboration and task
management. When it is off, public reads fail closed or return empty generic
states, mutation surfaces reject thread work, and clients hide thread routes and
controls. Persisted data remains available to cleanup, redaction, account
deletion, and archive enforcement.

## AI and memory

Assistant requests start from the current group and may broaden only to other accessible project context. Model calls receive bounded conversation, attachment text, and imported memory. Results stream through Convex and cite evidence where available.

Project-memory imports are asynchronous jobs. Convex tracks import ownership and status while Upstash Box stores the imported content. Typed public and internal Convex references preserve the trust boundary between user actions and background processing.

## Task management

Convex is authoritative for boards, workflow states, ranked tasks, labels,
references, comments, followers, activity, suggestion decisions, detection
cursors, reminders, notifications, and Company-exit snapshots. One central task
policy resolves legacy or exact Acting Company membership and rechecks Channel
access for every read and write. Project and Channel boards share the same task
model; original-scope evidence and history retain their own access boundary
after a task scope change.

New Channel messages schedule debounced, generation-safe detection jobs. The
Node task adapter routes live, bounded history, and traceable memory-import scans
through the existing OpenRouter provider. Structured output is validated before
suggestions are persisted, cursor advancement and candidate persistence share a
transaction, and durable tasks still require a human decision. The same adapter
has a deterministic fake for tests.

Web supplies Kanban/list views, routable task details, administration, Project
search, Channel panels, inline conversation cards, and suggestion review. Expo
uses state-grouped lists and status pickers, preserves task deep-link context,
and exposes no task dependency when the release flag is off.

## Generated files

- TanStack Router generates `apps/web/src/routeTree.gen.ts` from route files.
- Convex generates `convex/_generated/` from the schema and exported functions.

Regenerate these artifacts through their owning tool. Do not hand-maintain generated declarations as source design.

## Verification and delivery

CI installs with the frozen lockfile, then runs lint, typecheck, tests, the production dependency audit, and build. Web production output is generated under `apps/web/.output`. Native release builds are produced through EAS. Deployment identifiers and credentials stay in ignored local files or provider secret stores.
